## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
A condition will perform different actions based on what the user chooses. In life if your gas tank could be a condition of how far you can drive. IF your gas tank is full you can drive X amount of miles, else maybe go get more gas. In a web application if you're looking for a house and specify 2 bedroom the web application will say; IF bedroom == 2 then show, else hide.

2. Why might you want to use an `if` statement?
If we're asking the user for a condition we don't know. "Enter outside temperature: ", user enters temperature. IF temp > 75 "no need for a coat", else if temp < 75 "maybe take a coat".
We can also enter the data ourselves instead of asking the user in order to navigate a condition.

3. What is the JavaScript syntax for an `if` statement?
If is used to specify which code should be used. It will give two alternatives and choose based on what the user enters or what the variable has been assigned.

4. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement?
if (x == 1 && y ==4) this would need both conditions to be met, just add the && symbols between conditions.

5. What is the JavaScript syntax for an `if/else` statement?
Java will use if/else if there are multiple conditions. This will make a new condition be tested if the first is false.  IF this then A, else B.

6. Other than an `if` statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
I'm not sure I understand the question.
When we use booleans we are testing a condition of if its true or not. 24 > 25 is the condition and its false. But I'm not sure how you would be able to add more conditions to that.
