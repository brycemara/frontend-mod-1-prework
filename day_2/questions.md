## Day 2 Questions

1. Declare a variable named `animals` that stores an array containing the following strings: `"zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"`.
var animals = ["zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"];

2. Using the array `animals`, how would you access `"giraffe"`?
console.log(animals[1]);

3. How would you add `"lion"` to the `animals` array?
animals.push("Lion");

4. Name and describe two additional array methods.
animals.pop will delete the last variable in the animals array. So it would then be just ["zebra", "giraffe"].
console.log(animals.length); will return the length of the animals array. So this would return 3.

5. What are the boolean values in JavaScript?
true or false values.

6. In JavaScript, how would you evaluate if `2` is equal to `25`? What is the result of this evaluation?
console.log(2 == 25); this would return 'false'

7. In JavaScript, how would you evaluate if `25` is greater than `2`? What is the result of this evaluation?
console.log(25 > 2); this would return 'true'
