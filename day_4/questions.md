## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a function?
A set of parameters, statements, conditions that run in order to perform a certain task in java script.

2. What is a parameter?
A parameter is a piece of information passed to a function. Some functions may need information before they can do a task.

3. What is a return value?
After writing a function and expecting it to give you an answer or return value.

4. In the space below, declare a function named `hello` that will print to the console, `"Sam I am"`.
function hello() { console.log("Sam I am"); }

hello();

5. Declare a function name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and logs `name + " I am"`.
var name = "Sam"

function hello_someone() { console.log(name + "I am") }

6. How would you _call_ or _execute_ the function that you created above?
hell_someone();


7. What questions do you still have about functions in JavaScript?
I don't have a very clear understanding of arguments so I'd really want a teacher to go over it on a zoom class.
